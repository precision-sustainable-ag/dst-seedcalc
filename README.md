# Issues

We will organize issues in Projects to follow a Kanban style of project management.

# Development Cycles

We will begin by developing the core functionalties that both the NECCC and MCCC share.
From there we will fork the repository for the MCCC and again for the NECCC to support their specific process logic and the ui requirements those dictate.
